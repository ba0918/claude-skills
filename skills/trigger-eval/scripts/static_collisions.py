"""
trigger-eval: Static collision pre-pass.

Ranks description pairs by lexical Jaccard similarity. Pure functions, no LLM.
Used ONLY for defining "adjacent" skills for hard-negative case generation.

Not a predictor of measured confusion: in the 2026-07-27 run (188 cases) the
top 3 pairs by this ranking had zero confusion while the only confused pair
ranked 7th (#81). Confusion comes from missing discriminating information,
which vocabulary set operations cannot see — so this ranking must not drive
revision priority or merge-candidate nomination. Hard-negative generation
survives because it needs pairs that *look* confusable, not pairs that
*are* confused.

# the 98% / when 98% / use 98% / or 96% / user 96% / says 92% / and 90% -- the boilerplate
# `Use when the user says ...` rides on nearly every description. A token present in almost
# every document adds to both the intersection and the union of every pair, so it inflates
# Jaccard without discriminating anything. Japanese descriptions never showed this because
# their particles do not survive tokenization as separate words, which is why the noise only
# appeared after the corpus went English.
#
# This is a **fixed list, deliberately not a document-frequency cutoff**. A DF filter would
# adapt to the corpus, but this script feeds a measurement instrument: adding one skill would
# shift the vocabulary and therefore every pair score, so two runs would stop being comparable.
# The list holds grammatical words and convention boilerplate only -- never a domain word.
# Content words that happen to be common (`check`, `plan`, `review`, `skill`) stay in.
