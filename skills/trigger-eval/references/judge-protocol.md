# judge-protocol — the judging agent contract

The input/output contract for the Tier 1 selection simulation's judging agent (a subagent delegation, **model: sonnet stated explicitly**, a fresh subagent). For the general anti-bias rules (never hand over your own conclusion, adversarial framing, and so on), see the existing doctrine in `skills/shared/references/codex-integration.md`; it is not restated here.

## The 2 judging modes (selection / autonomous)

Judging is run in 2 independent modes. **The input/output schema is shared**; only the framing handed to the judging agent differs.

- **selection mode** (the traditional default behavior): "Pick the skill from the list that best fits the given instruction. If none fits, return `none`" = measures the discriminability of the description list. A framing that implicitly assumes a skill will be launched.
- **autonomous mode** (new): "You are a Claude Code assistant. Decide for yourself whether to respond to this user instruction normally or to launch a skill. Return a skill name only if you launch one; return `none` if you should respond normally" = does **not** force a skill launch. It measures a distribution closer to the salience with which a model decides in real use whether something "is worth launching a skill for".

Both modes use the same input schema and the same case batches, and **produce an independent judgment result JSON per mode** (`judged-{mode}-iterN.json`). The results must never be mixed (see the validity limits below).

## What is and is not handed to the judging agent

- **Handed over**: the description list (JSON of `{name, description}`) plus the batch of fictional instruction cases (an array of `{case_id, text}`).
- **Not handed over**: the body of SKILL.md. Showing the body diverges from what the model sees at real firing time and produces false positives (the same thinking as empirical-prompt-tuning Iteration 0). This reproduces the fact that at real firing time the model sees only the description.
- **Tool prohibition**: **switch the tool-prohibition wording in the prompt to match the distribution method** (never hand over a self-contradictory contract). For inline delivery: "use no tools at all; judge only from the given input". For file delivery: "you may read only the 2 files specified. Any other tool use or file read is forbidden". Either way it is a prompt-level **soft guarantee** and does not mechanically strip tool access (state this limit explicitly).

### Input distribution methods (the formal contract)

Input to the judging agent is limited to one of these 2 forms:

1. **Inline delivery**: embed the description list and the case batch directly in the prompt body. No additional file read occurs.
2. **File delivery**: allow reading **only 2 files** — `skills.json` (the description list) and the case batch file. Any tool use or file read beyond those 2 files is forbidden.

In both cases, **access to SKILL.md bodies and other sources is forbidden** (a soft guarantee). For file delivery, state "do not read anything but the 2 permitted files" explicitly in the prompt.

## Input schema

```json
{
  "skills": [{"name": "commit", "description": "..."}, ...],
  "cases": [{"case_id": "c001", "text": "commit this change"}, ...]
}
```

- **Chunk the batches to at most 20 cases per call.** Dispatch multiple batches concurrently (at most 4 in parallel).
- Shuffle the case order (to counter position bias).

## Output schema

The judging agent returns one label per case:

```json
{"judgments": [{"case_id": "c001", "choice": "commit"}, {"case_id": "c002", "choice": "none"}, ...]}
```

- `choice` is one of the skill names in the description list, or `none` (firing no skill is correct).
- **A single label only.** Never list several skills.

## Validation on collection (the driver's responsibility)

1. **Verify that "the number of judgments == the number of cases".**
2. Normalize `choice` (reduce to a bare name): strip any plugin prefix and align it to the same namespace as Phase 0.
3. **Producing INVALID** (owned by this document):
   - The whole batch response is unparseable → **re-judge every case_id in the batch exactly once**. If it is still malformed, materialize every case_id as `predicted=INVALID`.
   - An individual choice is (a) unparseable, (b) a skill name outside the list, or (c) several skills → re-judge that case exactly once. If it is still malformed, `INVALID`.
   - **How INVALID is counted** is owned by `metrics-spec.md` (counted as an FN for the correct skill, and as an FP for nothing).

## Measuring stability

Judge the same case independently twice (j1, j2). From the second iteration onward, **reduce by default to a fixed sample of 20-30 cases**. Choose the sample deterministically once, record it in the ledger, and use the same one across every iteration (`--full-stability` restores the full set).

## Skill name extraction and normalization in Tier 2 (real E2E firing)

Tier 2 uses the stream detection of the `run_eval.py` approach (`--output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages`, `content_block_start` → tool_use detection, removing the `CLAUDECODE` env var, terminating the process as soon as the first Skill tool_use is detected). Where run_eval does boolean detection, this skill **extracts the skill name from the Skill tool_use `input` and normalizes it to the same bare name as Phase 0** (for confusion attribution). **Do not specify a permission mode** (plan mode's system prompt changes the firing distribution and contaminates the calibration).

## Validity limits (things to state / knobs)

- The Tier 1 judging agent is a **selector** instructed to "pick one", and its distribution differs from autonomous firing (firing nothing and answering directly).
- **selection is an upper bound on discriminability; autonomous is an approximation of salience. Their distributions differ, so the results must never be mixed.** selection measures "given that something will be launched, which fits best" and therefore gives an upper bound on recall/precision, while autonomous includes "is this worth launching at all" and is closer to real-world salience. Mixing them averages two different populations and damages both signals.
- The judging model (a lightweight model) differs from the session model in real use.
- Therefore Tier 1 recall/precision is **a metric relative to a lightweight-model selector**, and **its divergence from Tier 2 real firing is the calibration signal**.
- "The judging model" and "the Tier 2 execution conditions (`--max-turns` / timeout / worktree)" are knobs.
- The judging agent's tool prohibition is a prompt-level **soft guarantee**.
