"""Build a process-delegation work queue from fixtures, and grade what comes back.

This is the producer side that `skills/shared/references/process-delegation.md` §11
deliberately leaves out of the shared runner: turning `fixtures.json` into prompt files
plus a `work.jsonl`, then reducing the returned artifacts to a mechanical tally.

It exists so a regression batch can run without spending subagent launches. The dispatch
contract is otherwise the one in `references/executor-contract.md`, with two adaptations
that the process path forces and one that it removes:

- The executor writes its report as **JSON to a declared path**, because the artifact is
  what the runner grades. Prose bullets are not machine-checkable.
- The prompt still withholds the `critical` flags; they live only in the batch manifest,
  so grading stays on the caller's side of the fence.
- The "report channel" problem disappears. A subagent's completion message may never be
  delivered; a file either exists or does not.

`grade` never returns a bare pass. It collapses the mechanical part of the judgement and
names what still needs adjudication, because executor-contract requires the caller to
re-judge any self-report the artifacts do not corroborate.
